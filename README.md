# ClientServerNPLab
To run the client-server application

Client APIs located in client.c

server.c calls student database APIs in the student.c

The application execution starts from the main.c which calls read_data function in the parser.c

With Makefile:

Step 1: Run "make server" and "make client" to get executables server and client respectively

Step 2: In one terminal, run "./server" and in another terminal run "./client <inputFile>"

Without Makefile:

gcc -o client main.c parser.c client.c

gcc -o server server.c student.c writer.c

In one terminal, run "./server" and in another terminal run "./client <inputFile>"
